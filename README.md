# Hi, I'm Erwyne Santos!

I am a DevOps Engineer and most of my main tasks consist of deployment, patching, OS hardening, configuration, troubleshooting, and maintenance of hundreds of servers through Ansible and Jenkins CI in the cloud.  

This is only a personal GitHub account for review and educational purposes. I hope I'll be able to help anyone with their projects both personally and at work in any of my repositories created.
