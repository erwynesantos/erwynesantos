# Hi, I'm Erwyne Santos!

I am a DevOps Engineer and most of my main tasks consist of deployment, patching, OS hardenning, configuration, troubleshooting and maintenance of hundreds of servers through Ansible and Jenkins CI in the cloud.
This is only a personal github account for review and educational purposes. I hope I can help you in some of your projects both personal and at work in any of my repositories created.
