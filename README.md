# Hey, I'm Erwyne Santos!

I am a System Administrator in a team of DevOps. My main tasks consist of deployment, patching, OS hardenning, configuration, troubleshooting and maintenance of hundreds of servers. On a good day, I get to automate a handful of these tasks to make my job easier using either python or bash scripts.  
I’m interested in music, mathematics, linux systems, container platforms and the whole idea of technological evolution in general.

## What I'm Focusing On
Currently learning Jenkins, Python, container platforms (RedHat Openshift/Kubernetes) and deployment, configuration, management and monitoring tools such as Ansible, Puppet and Centreon. I am also learning español, and the Spanish culture during my free time. 

## Hobbies and Interests :metal:
I also play the guitar and listen to a wide range of genres. I mainly play and listen to rock, blues and math-rock (bands like Polyphia) \
Only recently I've been hooked to Spanish music as weel!

Improving on the skills that I already posses and learning new things keep my brain stimulated which makes life, in my perspective, more exciting everyday.
